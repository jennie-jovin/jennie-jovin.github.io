    <h1>Filipino Traditions</h1>
    <h3>Cord Tradition</h3>
    <p>A cord, fashioned in the shape of an “8” or infinity sign, represents the infinite nature of marriage. The cord is place over the heads of both the bride and groom.</p>

    <h3>Unity Candle</h3>
    <p>The candles symbolize the Light of Christ, the same light they received at Baptism and now receive again to lead them in their new life as a couple. Some couples choose to have their mothers or fathers light the candles in this ritual.</p>

    <h3>Veil Tradition</h3>
    <p>A large veil is pinned on both the bride and groom to symbolize the unity of marriage (“two becoming one”).</p>

    <h3>The Principal Sponsors</h3>
    <p>These are women and men whom the bride and groom respect & admire. They are, as in the early days of the Church, sponsors of the couple attesting to their readiness for marriage and freedom to marry. These are often aunts and uncles or close friends of the family. In the Philippines, they are the official witnesses of the state and they sign the marriage license. Worldwide, their participation is symbolic of the wisdom & support they shall offer the new couple. The number of sponsors can vary from a single couple to many couples. The Principal sponsors are part of the bridal procession. At the nuptial blessing, they may also be invited to come up with the celebrant and to extend their right hands to join in the prayer of blessing. In doing so, they are fulfilling their roles as sponsors.</p>

    <h3>Money Dance</h3>
    <p>This is a popular dance during the wedding reception where guests can pin money onto the bride or groom in order to dance with them. If you’re not Filipino, this tradition seems a little strange, but it’s actually quite entertaining. By the end of the dance the couple is covered in bills, which they can then use for their honeymoon or to start their new life together.</p>

    <h1>Malayali Traditions</h1>
    <h3>Manthrakodi/Saree</h3>
    <p>A saree given as a gift to the bride from the groom and his family. Literally translated, its name mean "garment of prayers." The manthrakodi is symbolic of Christ's clothing His bride the Church with glory. It is put over the bride's head as a mantle and reflects the promise of the groom to honor, protect, and provide for his new bride for the rest of their lives.</p>

    <h3>Tying of the Thali</h3>
    <p>The thali is the foremost symbol of the covenant of marriage among Christians in India. It is leaf shaped pendant with a cross made of seven small beads in the center. The thali symbolizes the bond of marriage between husband and wife as a reflection of Christ's love for His bride, the Church. The thali is placed on a string made up of seven strands of thread taken from the manthrakodi and tied around the bride's neck by the groom. The knot reflects the permanence of marriage, and the bride wears the thali for the rest of her life as a sign of their marriage.</p>
